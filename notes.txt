This is the most important test. Try this exact sequence of prompts:

1.  **Initial Prompt:** `"Show me details for INC0000001."`
2.  **Follow-up 1:** `"Who is the caller for that ticket?"` (Tests if it remembers "that ticket" is INC0000001).
3.  **Follow-up 2:** `"Please add a note to it saying 'I have contacted the user for more information'."` (Tests if it still remembers "it" is INC0000001).
4.  **Context Switch:** `"Now, what about INC0000002?"`
5.  **Follow-up 3:** `"Can you search for any other tickets related to 'email'?"` (Tests if it can switch from a specific task to a general one).

Running through these prompts will give you a very clear picture of the agent's intelligence, its ability to use its tools, and its capacity to hold a natural conversation.
